# Tiny binarys

This is a collection of 32-bit assembly programs that are designed to have an extremely small executable file size. For example, hello world can be achieved in just 119 bytes. This is much smaller than a hello world program in C, compiled with `gcc`, stripped of symbols, and compressed with `upx` to 5672 bytes.

## Why?

I wanted an interesting learning challenge and to get more familiar with assembly. Practically, the space saved from these techniques is probably meaningless.
